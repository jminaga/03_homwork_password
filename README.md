# 03_homwork_password
This homework was to create a password generator using JavaScript.
<br> I am having trouble with the for loop to make a password that is the length of the input from the first prompt</br>
<br> If I cannot solve this by the time of grading I will more than likely need to re-submit for a better grade</br>
